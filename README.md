# ESP32_ADC_Hat

Main intentions for this code base is to work with the Seenov's (https://seenov.com) <b>RPI ADC Hat</b> product to help track directed energy weapons (DEW) to help protect civilians at home and religious settings.

Will contact Seenov owner, <i>Claude Arpin</i>, at a later point to see if this starting code base can be merged with theirs.
